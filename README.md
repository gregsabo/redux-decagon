# Redux decagon

A boilerplate based on [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example). This essentially removes the features that I don't need from the boilerplate to speed up the process of starting a new project for me. Huge thanks to @erikras and the other contributers on that project!
